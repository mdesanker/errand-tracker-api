# Errand App API

The goal of this project was to create a simple way to track and share errands with my partner through a web app. Errands can be grouped into projects as needed, marked with a due date or highlighted as urgent. Projects can be shared with specific other users.

This API supports the user auth, project, and errand operations for the errand app.
